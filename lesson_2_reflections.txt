What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A .git file is created and it tracks all the files inside that directory.
An empty repository is created which contains no commit. we need it to keep track of files we want.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
staging area is intermediate stage while making commit. files from working directory are added to staging area one at a time and then commit is made to store that logical change in repository which is the snapshot of current state of file.
Gives more control and allows to make commits small with one commit per logical change. specifies exactly what changes to be committed. Entire content of  area bundled into single commit and added to repository

change?
