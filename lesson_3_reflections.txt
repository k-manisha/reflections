When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I would use a remote repository to keep backup of my work, collaborate with people and to share my code with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I want to pull changes manually so that my contents or code don't change without my will and expectation. I may want to make changes again and again before pulling final change to a logic or block of code.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?
    fork is used to get some other person's repository into your github.
    clone means to get a repository on your local machine for offline uses.
    branches are used to keep master file entact and experiment on their copies so that finall change can be merged to master. 
    this enables master to always stay error free.
